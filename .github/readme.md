# Fresh Life

Fresh Life is a static, responsive website designed in a way that imitates a page for a company or organization promoting a healthy lifestyle.

## About the Project

The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and fresh design that is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.

### Animations
Animations throughout the site have been implemented using the Intersection Observer API. This allows for certain animations to trigger when an element enters the viewport, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
